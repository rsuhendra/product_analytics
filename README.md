# Product Analytics Project: Optimizing Banner Performance for an Online Sporting Goods Store

### Introduction

In e-commerce, understanding user behavior and optimizing marketing strategies are key to driving sales and revenue. This project analyzes the effectiveness of promotional banners on an online sporting goods store's main page. The store displays one of five randomly selected banners, each advertising a product or the company. Using **A/B testing**, we aim to determine how well each banner performs in driving user engagement (clicks) and conversions (orders). The insights will help the store manager decide whether to keep, replace, or optimize the banners for better performance.

### Dataset Overview

The dataset, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/podsyp/how-to-do-product-analytics/data), contains the following information about user interactions:

- **Time of Interaction**: Timestamp of user interactions.
- **Banner Interaction**: Whether the user clicked on a banner.
- **Order Placement**: Whether the user placed an order.
- **Banner Type**: The type of banner displayed (one of five options).

### Project Objectives

- **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful features from the raw data, such as time-based metrics (e.g., time of day, day of week) and user engagement patterns.
- **Data Exploration**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and identify key trends and patterns.
- **Banner Performance Analysis**: Analyze the performance of each banner in terms of click-through rates (CTR) and conversion rates (orders) using **A/B testing** to compare the effectiveness of different banners.
- **User Behavior Analysis**: Investigate how user interactions vary by time of day, day of week, and banner type.
- **Actionable Insights**: Provide actionable insights and recommendations to the store manager on which banners perform best and how to optimize their placement and design.

### Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: PySpark, XGBoost, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Conclusion

This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of banner performance and user behavior for an online sporting goods store. By leveraging data-driven insights and **A/B testing**, we can help the store manager make informed decisions about which banners to keep, replace, or optimize to maximize user engagement and conversions.
